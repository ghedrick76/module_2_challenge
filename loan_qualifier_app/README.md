# Project Title
Loan Qualifer Application

This application allows a user to input their credit score, monthly debt, income, desired loan value, and the value of the home they're loaning against.  It then calculates their debt-to-income ratio and the loan-to-value ratio, and selects eligible loans from a list of data.  The user can then save their results to a CSV file.
